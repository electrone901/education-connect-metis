# 1-page abstract with the definition of the problem to solve and resolution approach

Many entrepreneurs have great ideas and talent but many times they lack important resources such as space or platforms to develop and build their network, professional connections and obtain financial opportunities.

Currently many of these projects end  abruptly either by lack of any of the above mentioned resources or someone else coming up with the same idea but with more opportunities to complete the project.

EducationConnect aims to be an open source platform that helps students, professors, institutions, philanthropists and people to protect their intellectual ideas through a decentralized and transparent way using blockchain technology to document each journey from start to finish while protecting its privacy.


The mission of EducationConnect is to enable people to take ownership of their works, projects, and ideas through a representation of NFTs that they can sell, swap or rent. Each idea/project is represented as an NFT that holds a financial value. The way it works is by a simple process where the user shares their awesome idea within our platform, we generate a Non Fungible Token, then the user invites people, mentors, experts and investors, to join his/her project by offering funder benefits and incentives.

 We are providing users with the necessary tools and resources allowing Individual/Institutions to fund entrepreneurs projects for further education, research, and progress. This creates new opportunities for people to secure their work, project, and ideas as an NFT.

# 1-page scope of work with a draft budget to take proof of concept to prototype (budget will not be provided by the Hackathon, the purpose of the requisite is for cost-effect awareness)
For this prototype we need the following:

### Design
For the web design we are considering spending $500 - $1000.  We want a better design and user flow.

### Web Development
For web development we are considering spending $5000 - $8000.  We want to build a secure, scalable and efficient app. Having all these can make a big difference on our users.  This step will also include Security and Testing.


Domain Names and servers    Approximate $500 per month
For the domain name we are considering to spend $100 - $200 per year
For the servers we are considering to spend $250 - $500 per month
These are decisive factors in our web  app because our backend needs to do calculations, fetch data and deal with text or media, such as photo, video, or audio.


Monitoring
For the web analytics and monitoring we are considering spending $150 - $200 per month. This will help us to keep track of our users and to gather data about the web usage.


Social Media Presence
For social media presence we are still working on.



# 1-page description of the technology that will be used
This application uses the following technologies:

Metis Network: we developed our platform using Metis and Metis Network

NFTStorage: we used NFTStorage  for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to retrieve the NFT

Solidity: we used Solidity for the smart contract

OpenZeppelin ERC72: we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of the smart contract

Ganache for local blockchain development

4everland: We used 4everland as the web hosting for web3 where we deployed our app

React Js, Material-ui, Web3:  React Js for the frontend, Material-ui and Web3 to connect to blockchain
